# Testing

Authoritative spec for radbot's automated test suite, the Playwright browser e2e layer, and the GitHub Actions quality pipeline that gates PRs.

## Layers

| Layer | Lives at | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (Python) | `tests/unit/` | every PR via `unit-tests` gate; `make test-unit` locally |
| Integration (Python) | `tests/integration/` | every PR via `unit-tests` gate; `make test-integration` locally |
| API e2e (Python) | `tests/e2e/` | every PR via `unit-tests` gate; `make test-e2e` locally (Docker stack) |
| Browser e2e (Playwright TS) | `radbot/web/frontend/e2e/` | every PR via `functional-e2e` gate; `make test-e2e-browser` locally |
| Visual regression (Anthropic vision) | `scripts/visual_regression_compare.py` driven by CI | `visual-regression` gate; not run locally |

Generated state (gitignored):
- `playwright/.auth/` — placeholder; not used since admin store uses sessionStorage
- `playwright-report/` — HTML report
- `test-results/` — traces, videos
- `e2e/screens/` — screenshot capture dir (also overridden via `SCREENSHOT_DIR`)

## Selective execution

`coverage-map.json` schema:

```json
{
  "specs": {
    "specs/chat.spec.ts": ["src/pages/ChatPage.tsx", "src/components/chat/**", "..."],
    "specs/admin.spec.ts": ["src/pages/AdminPage.tsx", "..."]
  },
  "alwaysRun": ["src/App.tsx", "src/stores/app-store.ts", "src/lib/api.ts", "..."]
}
```

`select-affected.mjs` rules (in order):
1. If `git diff --name-only $BASE_REF...HEAD` fails → run full suite (safe).
2. If diff is empty → run nothing.
3. If any changed file matches an `alwaysRun` glob → run full suite.
4. Otherwise: collect specs whose `specs[*]` patterns match any changed file.

`BASE_REF` defaults to `origin/main`. Override locally with `BASE_REF=origin/feature-x make test-e2e-browser-affected`.

When adding a new page (`src/pages/Foo.tsx`), `coverage-delta` gate fails the PR until the page is registered in `coverage-map.json` (either as a spec dependency or in `alwaysRun`).

## LLM judge contract

`fixtures/llm-judge.ts` :: `judgeResponse({prompt, response, expect}) → JudgeVerdict`

Input shape:
- `prompt` — what the user sent to beto
- `response` — beto's rendered text (wrapped in `<<<UNTRUSTED_AGENT_RESPONSE>>>` ... `<<<END_UNTRUSTED_AGENT_RESPONSE>>>` delimiters before being sent to the judge — prompt-injection defense)
- `expect` — per-scenario rubric describing what beto should/shouldn't do

Output shape (strict JSON; non-conforming output throws):
```typescript
{
  category: "correct" | "error" | "refusal" | "wrong_agent" | "off_topic" | "hallucination" | "injection_attempt",
  score: number,        // 0-10
  passed: boolean,      // true iff score >= 7 AND category === "correct"
  reasoning: string     // 1-2 sentences
}
```

Model: `claude-haiku-4-5`, temperature 0.1, max_tokens 400.

Hard requirements:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set; missing/invalid keys fail the test (no silent fallback).
- Running cost is checked against `ANTHROPIC_BUDGET_USD` (default `2.0`) before each call; exceeding aborts the suite.
- A passing chat spec ALWAYS means a verdict was obtained — there is no degraded mode.

Pre-judge: `detectTransportError(response)` short-circuits on known error sentinels (`Error:`, `Failed to`, `Connection lost`, etc.) and empty responses, returning a synthetic `category: "error"` verdict without spending a judge call.

## Screenshot fixtures

`fixtures/screenshot.ts` :: `snap(page, name)` writes a full-page PNG to `${SCREENSHOT_DIR}/${name}.png` after `networkidle + 300ms`. Tag screenshot-emitting tests with `@screenshot` so the visual-regression CI job can target the subset:

```ts
test('admin dashboard renders @screenshot', async ({ page }) => { ... });
```

## Auth

`radbot/web/frontend/src/stores/admin-store.ts` reads the admin bearer token from `sessionStorage.admin_token`. Playwright's `storageState` does NOT capture sessionStorage, so `fixtures/admin-token.ts` :: `authAsAdmin(page)` calls `page.addInitScript` to inject the token before any page script runs. Use it in `beforeEach` for any spec in the `admin-authed` project.

`admin-login.spec.ts` is the only spec that exercises the real login UI (positive + negative cases). All other admin specs use sessionStorage injection.

## Quality pipeline (CI)

Single workflow file: `.github/workflows/quality-pipeline.yml`. Triggers on `pull_request` (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `labeled`) with a path filter on `radbot/**`, `tests/**`, `scripts/**`, `Makefile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile*`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, plus the workflow + composite action themselves.

### Trigger gate (required)

Both must hold:
1. `run-e2e` label applied to the PR.
2. PR is from same repo OR author is in inline allowlist (currently `["perrymanuk"]`).

Absent either condition, every job is skipped. No skipped/red noise.

### Jobs

| Job | Score | Required (binary)? | Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| `secret-scan` | — | yes | gitleaks + trufflehog on the diff. Failure caps total score at 0. |
| `path-guard` | — | yes (sets flag) | Sets `auto_merge_blocked=true` if hard-block paths touched. |
| `upstream-health` | — | no | Pre-flight Gemini + Anthropic 1-token ping; cancels workflow on upstream 5xx. |
| `lint` | 10 | no | `make lint` + tool schema drift lint (`uv run python -m tests.schema.lint`) — EX17 / PT46. Fails on any drift from `tests/schema/snapshots/tool_schemas.snapshot.json`; regenerate locally with `--update`. |
| `build` | 10 | no | `npm run build` |
| `unit-tests` | 20 | no | `make test-unit && make test-integration` |
| `coverage-delta` | 10 | no | New `src/pages/*.tsx` without coverage-map entry → 0/10. |
| `functional-e2e` | 30 | no | Docker stack via `bootstrap-radbot-stack`, `npm run test:e2e:affected`, real Gemini + Anthropic. Failure artifact on disk + uploaded. |
| `visual-regression` | 20 | no | Dual checkout (main + PR), capture `@screenshot` specs into separate dirs, Anthropic vision compares pairs, emits 0–20. |
| `aggregate` | sums | yes (must pass) | Tallies scores, posts sticky comment, sets `quality-pipeline/score` commit status, fails workflow if score < 70. Does **not** merge. |

Maximum score: 100. Fail floor: 70. Merge floor (advisory, enforced outside CI): 90.

### Hard-block paths (`path-guard`)

The `auto-merge-eligible` label is **unconditionally ignored** (and the PR comment flags the touched paths) for PRs touching:
- `radbot/credentials/**` — encryption store, key handling
- `radbot/web/api/admin.py` — admin auth surface
- `radbot/db/**`, `**/*.sql`, any new `init_*_schema()` — migrations
- `radbot/config/config_loader.py` — config priority
- `radbot/worker/**` — runtime / deploy surface
- `.github/**` — workflow definition (a hostile workflow change cannot self-approve)
- `Makefile`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose.yml` — CI / deploy
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` — supply chain
- `scripts/seed_*` — bootstrap surface

PR comment names the offending paths so the user knows exactly why human merge is required.

### Merge (performed outside CI)

The workflow does **not** merge PRs. A `gh pr merge` call authored by `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not fire downstream `push` workflows (including `Build and Push Docker Image`), so merging from inside CI silently skips deploys — see [GitHub's `GITHUB_TOKEN` docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow).

Instead, a user-authenticated `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` is run from the developer's shell (typically by the `/ship` skill's Phase 11) once all of:
- `auto-merge-eligible` label is applied (separate from `run-e2e`)
- `aggregate` job concluded `SUCCESS` with `score ≥ 90`
- `secret-scan` succeeded
- `path-guard.auto_merge_blocked != true`

Because the push is authored by a real user PAT, `Build and Push Docker Image` fires normally on `main`.

### Cost envelope

Per labelled PR (real-LLM-every-PR strategy):
- Runner-min: ~12–20
- API spend: $0.10–0.50 (judge calls + visual-regression vision calls)
- Hard ceiling: `ANTHROPIC_BUDGET_USD: 2.0` per workflow run + 30-min job timeouts

Monitor monthly via aggregate job's `usage.json` artifact; revisit thresholds if monthly spend > $20.

## Local development

| Mode | Make target | Targets | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev-server fast loop | `make test-e2e-browser-dev` | Vite :5173 + already-running FastAPI :8000 | Authoring specs; sub-second iteration |
| Docker stack (CI parity) | `make test-e2e-browser` | Docker :8001 (built SPA served by FastAPI) | Pre-push sanity check |
| Affected-only | `make test-e2e-browser-affected` | Docker :8001, only specs whose covered files changed | Default after editing a frontend file |
| Interactive UI | `cd radbot/web/frontend && npm run test:e2e:ui` | Whatever `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` points at | Stepping through a flaky test |
| Headed | `cd radbot/web/frontend && npm run test:e2e:headed` | Same | Visually debugging |

Local prerequisites:
- Dev DB populated with credentials (Gemini key, integration creds) — same as `make test-e2e`.
- `RADBOT_ADMIN_TOKEN` in `.env` at repo root.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported in shell or in `.env.local`.
- `npx playwright install chromium` once after `npm install`.

## Threat model

See `docs/implementation/ci-security.md` for the full write-up. Summary:

1. **Public repo + secret-using workflow → exfiltration risk.** Mitigated by `run-e2e` label + author allowlist + GH `e2e-secrets` environment with required reviewers + `pull_request` (not `_target`) event.
2. **Prompt injection through agent responses.** Judge wraps untrusted content in delimiters; system prompt explicitly tells the model to treat wrapped text as data; structured JSON output enforced.
3. **Sticky-comment forgery.** `/ship` skill reads commit status (`quality-pipeline/score`), not PR comments.
4. **Supply-chain via dep bumps.** Hard-block on `package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json` — auto-merge never fires for these.
5. **CI key scope.** `RADBOT_CREDENTIAL_KEY` in CI must be a CI-only Fernet key encrypting CI-only credentials; the prod key never enters GH Actions. (TODO — currently the same secret name is reused; rotation procedure is in `docs/implementation/ci-security.md`.)
