# Minimal bootstrap config for Docker Compose development.
# Mirrors the Nomad production pattern: only database + vector_db here,
# everything else is configured via the Admin UI (/admin/) and stored
# in the PostgreSQL credential store.
#
# Environment variables are interpolated by config_loader at startup.

  host: "${POSTGRES_HOST}"

  host: "${QDRANT_HOST}"
